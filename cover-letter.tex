    I am writing to apply for the Newsroom Strategy Manager position at The New York Times.

    \vspace{1em}

    I believe in rigor. I believe in principle. I believe that every detail matters. 

    \vspace{1em}

    In my previous role as a Media Strategist and Analytics Engineer at Penske Media Corporation, I developed comprehensive reporting infrastructure for the audience marketing, subscription, editorial, and SEO teams. I focused on integrating massive amounts of data into pragmatic solutions. I met daily with core stakeholders to strategically guide responses to audience signals uncovered within our data streams.  
    
    \vspace{1em}

    I also developed generative AI application stacks to integrate AI tools into existing WordPress workflows. I worked directly with senior executives to plan Penske's AI strategy, evaluate vendors, and forecast the financial prospects of these pursuits. I doubled as an engineer and strategist capable of building and evaluating the utility of integrating AI into the newsroom. 
    
    \vspace{1em}

    I am proficient in SQL and multiple data environments. I frankly love to automate processes with Python and Bash scripts. Regardless, I believe data and tech are tools that inform and reduce operational friction. Valid analysis driven by accurate data and rigorous planning is only one component of a successful business strategy. Ultimately, the practitioners enable an initiative to succeed. Journalists, data scientists, and IT staff must all be capable and willing to align with business goals.

    
    \vspace{1em}

    I value establishing strong relationships with stakeholders based on mutual respect. Every new initiative should be evaluated for its impact on newsroom staff. I prioritize maintaining effective processes over adopting new technologies for their own sake. Every voice matters, and each person contributes to the success of our strategic goals.

    
    \vspace{1em}

    In all my work, I am guided by a commitment to integrity and the value of independent thought. As a research assistant, I led data teams to investigate the impact of war and oppression as truthfully as possible. It is painful, but it is important to detail the reality of the lives of people bound by circumstances beyond their control. Dr. Attar's video—recently published by The Times—explicitly showing the human toll in Gaza shook me to my core. I believe this is the role of journalism and The New York Times. I want to be a part of it.
