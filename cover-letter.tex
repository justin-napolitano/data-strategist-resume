    I am writing to apply for the Electoral Research Position at the Associated Press.

    \vspace{1em}

    I want to begin this letter by stating that I believe in upholding rigor, acting according to principle, and ensuring impartial analysis backed by valid data. 

    \vspace{1em}

    My first professional role was as a Research Assistant at the University of Central Florida. I collaborated with Dr. Demet Mousseau to develop an event-level database of human rights violations committed by every party of the Turkish-Kurdish Conflict. My role required that I build a matrix of human rights law provisions to enable a rotating team of research assistants to accurately and agnostically code violations. I systematized the data verification procedures and scripted the data cleaning methodology. Our work was published by DeGruyter in 2019 and presented at The Hague.
    
    \vspace{1em}

    % I met daily with core stakeholders to strategically guide responses to audience signals uncovered within our data streams.  

    \vspace{1em}
    In addition to my engineering role, I spearheaded research of Penske's three hundred (+) million audience by building out automated analyses of web behavior and purchasing behavior to understand the interests of audiences down to the zip code. I also planned data-driven business-to-business marketing campaigns that successfully drove increased subscription volume across the portfolio.
    
    \vspace{1em}

    I am proficient in SQL dialects unique to BigQuery, Snowflake, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I know Python and Julia well enough to clean and analyze data at scale. I can also work with SAS and SPSS statistical software.  
    
    \vspace{1em}

    That said, data and tech are tools that inform decision-making and reduce operational friction. Valid analysis requires rigorous planning and a commitment to impartiality. Ultimately, research initiatives succeed when data practitioners surrender themselves to transparency and neutrality. I am dedicated to upholding the high standards of the Associated Press and have a track record of producing non-partisan analysis. I believe I will be an asset to AP. Please consider my application.
    
    % I value establishing strong relationships with stakeholders based on mutual respect. Every new initiative should be evaluated for its impact on newsroom staff. I prioritize maintaining effective processes over adopting new technologies for their own sake. Every voice matters, and each person contributes to the success of strategic goals.

    \vspace{1em}

    % In all my work, I am guided by a commitment to integrity and the value of independent thought. As a research assistant, I led data teams to investigate the impact of war and oppression as truthfully as possible. It is painful, but it is important to detail the reality of the lives of people bound by circumstances beyond their control. Dr. Attar's video—recently published by The Times—explicitly showing the human toll in Gaza shook me to my core. I believe this is the role of journalism and The New York Times. I want to be a part of it.

    Sincerely,
