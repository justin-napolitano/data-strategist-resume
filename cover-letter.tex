    I am writing to apply for the vacant Open Source Information (OSI) Analyst (25403) position.

    \vspace{1em}

    I want to begin this letter by stating that I believe in rigor, I stand by my principles, and I consider every detail to be important.

    \vspace{1em}
    I am a published researcher experienced in identifying human rights abuses of the Turkish-Kurdish Conflict. The intent of my work was to maintain an agnostic position in order to detail the impact on people regardless of affiliation. I developed—in collaboration with Dr. Demet Mousseau—a human rights law framework to permit a team of research assistants to systematically code violations. My role entailed organizing pertinent Human Rights Law clauses into a matrix that could be referenced by a rotating team of analysts. We mined data from international news wires and communicated directly with organizations within Turkey to validate our information.
    \vspace{1em}
    
    My most recent role was that of a data strategist and data engineer at Penske Media Corporation. I was required to develop comprehensive reporting infrastructure for audience marketing, editorial, and SEO teams. I integrated massive amounts of data to permit key stakeholders to strategically guide the business in response to audience signals.
    
    \vspace{1em}

    In addition to my role as a developer, I worked directly with senior executives to plan business strategy, evaluate vendors, and forecast the financial prospects of new initiatives.
    
    \vspace{1em}

    I am proficient in SQL, BigQuery, and Snowflake. I am a confident cloud developer. I am a capable Python and Bash programmer. I speak and read basic French, basic Arabic, and basic Spanish.  
    
    \vspace{1em}

    Please consider my application. I believe I will be an asset to the organization.

    % I value establishing strong relationships with stakeholders based on mutual respect. Every new initiative should be evaluated for its impact on newsroom staff. I prioritize maintaining effective processes over adopting new technologies for their own sake. Every voice matters, and each person contributes to the success of strategic goals.

    
    \vspace{1em}

    % In all my work, I am guided by a commitment to integrity and the value of independent thought. As a research assistant, I led data teams to investigate the impact of war and oppression as truthfully as possible. It is painful, but it is important to detail the reality of the lives of people bound by circumstances beyond their control. Dr. Attar's video—recently published by The Times—explicitly showing the human toll in Gaza shook me to my core. I believe this is the role of journalism and The New York Times. I want to be a part of it.

    \vspace{1em}

    \noindent
    Sincerely,

    \vspace{1em}
